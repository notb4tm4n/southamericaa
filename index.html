        <h1>Impact of Climate Change on South America</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>South America, with its rich ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest, Andes mountains, and coastal regions, faces serious consequences from climate change. These effects harm not only natural habitats but also people’s livelihoods and regional biodiversity, making the continent highly vulnerable.</p>

        <h2>1. Effects on Human Well-being</h2>
        <p>Climate change in South America has direct and indirect effects on people’s well-being, impacting health, food, water, and causing displacement.</p>

        <h3>Health Impacts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rising temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and expand tropical diseases, such as dengue and malaria, into new areas, threatening public health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic Impacts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With economies dependent on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, changes in rainfall and prolonged droughts lead to crop losses and income reduction. Fishing communities also struggle as warming oceans reduce fish stocks, affecting food and livelihood.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Social Impacts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Extreme weather events like floods and droughts force many to migrate, leading to overcrowded urban areas and strained resources in cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Impact on Nature and Vegetation</h2>
        <p>South America's rich biodiversity is affected by climate change, causing habitat loss, shifts in biodiversity, and putting ecosystems at risk.</p>

        <h3>Amazon Rainforest and Biodiversity Loss:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Amazon, crucial for carbon absorption, is threatened by droughts and forest fires. This disrupts its ecosystem and endangers species like jaguars and macaws, impacting indigenous communities that depend on the forest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Andes Mountains and Water Supply:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Glacial melt in the Andes threatens water availability in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, affecting millions who rely on glacial water for drinking and farming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coastal Ecosystems and Coral Reefs:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rising sea levels and ocean acidification damage coral reefs, essential to marine biodiversity and fishing economies. Coral degradation harms fish populations, affecting food sources for coastal communities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Adaptation Efforts and Challenges</h2>
        <p>South American countries are adopting adaptation measures, though challenges remain due to limited resources and social inequalities.</p>

        <h3>Community-Led Conservation and Sustainable Agriculture:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Countries like Brazil and Peru encourage sustainable farming to reduce deforestation and protect ecosystems, with indigenous communities playing a key role.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>National and Regional Climate Policies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Governments are working on climate policies and international commitments, though limited funding and infrastructure hinder effective implementation.</li>
        </ul>
